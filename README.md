This is my car dekho project 
Author - Aradhya Gupta
Performed an in-depth analysis of Car Dekho's sales data using SQL. The project involved data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) to prepare the dataset for analysis. Key tasks included identifying sales trends, analyzing customer demographics, and evaluating the performance of various car models. Complex SQL queries were used to generate insights on factors influencing sales, such as pricing, customer preferences, and regional distribution. The results provided actionable insights to enhance decision-making and optimize sales strategies.
